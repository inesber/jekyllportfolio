    <h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Inês, and I'm a Product Designer, Content Writer &amp; Front End Developer from Lisbon,
        Portugal. I know these might seem like a lot of
        things, but let me explain.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the day, I work as a Junior Product Designer at Farfetch, but I also
        love writing and doing some coding, things I
        like to do in my free time.

        When I'm not working on those, I also like to paint - primarily gouache and sketching - and reading.
